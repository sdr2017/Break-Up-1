# BREAKUP SHAKEUP

There are numerous apps to assist you in your quest to find love in the digital age. BUT there are no apps to assist you when that love betrays you. Ok maybe there are some breakup apps out there, but my group and I wanted to create something lighthearted that would assist the user throughout the various stages of a breakup. 

Something important to note, WE ARE NOT PSYCHOLOGISTS or qualified to advise on relationships in any way. The app is intended for entertainment purposes only.


## How it works

A heartbroken user stubles across our app in search of assistance navigating the stages of their breakup. They are prompted to input information, including the date of their breakup. Our app uses moment.js to determine how long it's been since their breakup, and uses that time to place them in the appropriate stage. Their information is stored in Firebase so that when they return to the site and log in with their email, they will automatically be placed in the appropriate stage regardless of where they were originally placed.

Each stage includes a playlist, book recommendations, and movie recommendations fitting for that stage. The user may use the as an aid to recovery. We placed the playlists into the app using Spotify's iframe, and the books and movies both pull their information from an API. 

## My Contribution

I was responsible for the general user interface and design/overall look of the website. I was also responsible for some user validation where emails were concerned as well as troubleshooting and debugging the JavaScript.
